                The above video sheds light on Basic Probability Concepts like random experiments, sample space, events and its types,
                addition rule, conditional probability and its properties, multiplication theorem, independent events and total probability theorem.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Probability</b> is Number of favourable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGgWe58fbm4?start=43">0:43</a></li>
                 
                <li><b>Sample Space</b> is the collection of all possible outcomes of an experiment
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGgWe58fbm4?start=170">2:50</a>
                </li>
                <li>An <b>Event</b> is an outcome of a random experiment. It is the subset of the sample space
                </li>
                <li>Event that is sure to happen or whose probability is 1 is called a <b>sure event</b>, whereas the event whose probability
                        is 0 is said to be an <b>impossible event</b>
                </li>
                <li>Two events are said to be <b>mutually exclusive</b> if they cannot occur at the same time, implies that the 
                        probability of the intersection of the events is 0
                </li>
                <li>A set of events is said to be <b>exhaustive</b> if atleast one of them occurs. Union of these events is sample space
                </li>
                <li>With the <b>addition rule of probability</b>, probability of unuion of two or more events can be found
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGgWe58fbm4?start=390">6:30</a>
                </li>
                <li><b>Conditional probability</b> is the probability of an event occuring, given the occurence 
                    of a prevoius event
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGgWe58fbm4?start=840">14:00</a>
                </li>
                <li><b>Multiplication theorem</b> on probability states that the probability of simultaneous occurrence of two events A and B 
                    is equal to the product of the probability of the other, given that the first one has occurred. 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGgWe58fbm4?start=1595">26:35</a>
                </li>
                <li>Two or more events are said to be <b>independent</b> if the occurence of one event doesn't impact 
                    the other events
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGgWe58fbm4?start=1836">30:36</a>

            <p>The above video will provide a general insight on what probability distribution functions, cumulative
                distribution functions are.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>probability distribution function</b> gives the occurrence of different possible outcomes for an
                    experiment. It can be described by either a <b>probability mass function, probability density function
                    or cumulative distribution functions</b>.</li>
                <li>A probability mass function <b>(PMF)</b> gives the probability that a discrete random variable is equal to
                    some value</li>
                <li>A probability density function <b>(PDF)</b> value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space
                    (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative
                    likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample</li>
                <li>A cumulative distribution function <b>(CDF)</b> evaluates the probability that X will take a value less than or
                    equal to x for a discrete random variable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The above video will very quickly summarise most of the discreet and continuous distributions of
                probability. It contains: Binomial, Bernoulli, Poisson, Normal, Standard Normal, Student T and Chi-
                Squared</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Probability distributions are usually divided into two classes: discrete probability distributions or
                    continuous probability distributions</li>
                <li>A <b>discrete probability distribution</b> is the probability distribution of a random variable that can take
                    on only a countable number of values. They include Poisson distribution, Bernoulli distribution,
                    binomial distribution, geometric distribution</li>
                <li>A <b>continuous probability distribution</b> is a probability distribution whose support is an uncountable
                    set, such as an interval in the real line. They are uniquely characterized by a cumulative distribution
                    function that can be used to calculate the probability for each subset of the support. They include
                    Normal distribution, Uniform Distributions, Chi-squared, and more</li>
